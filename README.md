Ansible: Opencast Nginx Role
============================

[![lint](https://github.com/elan-ev/opencast_nginx/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/elan-ev/opencast_nginx/actions/workflows/lint.yml?branch=main)
[![molecule](https://github.com/elan-ev/opencast_nginx/actions/workflows/molecule.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/elan-ev/opencast_nginx/actions/workflows/molecule.yml?branch=main)

This Ansible role installs and prepares Nginx as reverse proxy for Opencast.
If no certificate is present, this role deploys a dummy certificate which allows Nginx to start up.

Dependencies
------------

This role uses the [community.crypto.openssl_dhparam](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/crypto/openssl_dhparam_module.html) module
to generate Diffie-Hellman parameters. You therefor need to have the [community.crypto collection](https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/general) installed.

Role Variables
--------------

- `opencast_storage_downloads_path`
    - Path to Opencast's downloads directory (default: `/srv/opencast/downloads/`)
- `opencast_cors_urls`
    - List of URLs to add CORS exceptions for (default: `[]`)


Additional Configuration
------------------------

While this deploys dummy TSL certificates which allow Nginx to start up,
make sure to deploy proper certificates for production.
To do that, copy your certificates to:

- `/etc/nginx/ssl/{{ inventory_hostname }}.key`
- `/etc/nginx/ssl/{{ inventory_hostname }}.crt`

If you want to use Let's Encrypt to generate certificates, you can also include the role
[`elan.opencast_certbot`](https://galaxy.ansible.com/elan/opencast_certbot)
which will automatically generate TLS certificates for you.

You can also add some custom configuration in the file `/etc/nginx/conf.d/extra.conf`.
The file is included after Opencast's main `location` block.
The role will not modify this file if it exists.

Additionally you can define other virtual hosts in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` directory.
They will be loaded as well.


Example Playbook
----------------

Example of how to configure and use the role:

```yaml
- hosts: servers
  become: true
  roles:
    - role: elan.opencast_nginx
```

This will leave you with an invalid dummy certificate.
You will need to replace it with a valid one before booting up Opencast.
The role will _not_ replace an existing certificate so you can safely use a `file` task to deploy it afterwards:

```yaml
- hosts: servers
  become: true
  tasks:
    - include_role:
        name: elan.opencast_nginx

    - name: install tls certificate
      copy:
        src: tls-{{ item }}.pem
        dest: /etc/nginx/ssl/{{ inventory_hostname }}.{{ item }}
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: '0400'
      notify: Reload nginx
      loop:
        - key
        - crt
```

Development Environment
----------------

For linting and role development you can use the tools defined in [development requirements](.dev_requirements.txt).
You can quickly install them in a python virtual environment like this:

```sh
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# Activate the virtual environment
. venv/bin/activate
# Install the dependencies
pip install -r .dev_requirements.txt
```

E.g. you can then install the ansible requirements or run the linter (`yamllint -c .yamllint . && ansible-lint`).

For development and testing you can use [molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
With podman as driver you can install it like this â€“ preferably in a virtual environment:

```bash
pip install -r .dev_requirements.txt
```

Then you can *create* the test instances, apply the ansible config (*converge*) and *destroy* the test instances with these commands:

```bash
molecule create
molecule converge
molecule destroy
```

If you want to inspect a running test instance use `molecule login --host <instance_name>`, where you replace `<instance_name>` with the desired value.
